# StakingModelSimulation

The Staking Model Simulator is a simple webapp, which is available for user browsing on https://simulator.gooddollar.org

All data in the simulator is hard-coded, based on our Excel models for simplicity. Overtime, we aim for people to implement smart-contracts formulas

Feel free to ping us if you can take this on.


Thank you,
